```js

  // Create a copy of this date object
  var target  = new Date(d.valueOf());

  // ISO week date weeks start on monday
  // so correct the day number
  var dayNr   = (d.getDay() + 6) % 7;

  // Set the target to the thursday of this week so the
  // target date is in the right year
  target.setDate(target.getDate() - dayNr + 3);

  // ISO 8601 states that week 1 is the week
  // with january 4th in it
  var jan4    = new Date(target.getFullYear(), 0, 4);

  // Number of days between target date and january 4th
  var dayDiff = (target - jan4) / 86400000;

  // Calculate week number: Week 1 (january 4th) plus the
  // number of weeks between target date and january 4th
  var weekNr = 1 + Math.ceil(dayDiff / 7);

  return weekNr;
}

// Use to pull current date
// var now = new Date();
// weekNum(now);

// Pulls date from date field
var date = DATEVALUE($date);
weekNum(date);
