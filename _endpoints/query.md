The Query API provides read-only access to interact with your Fulcrum tables and data (records, repeatables, choice lists, members, media, etc.). This endpoint supports most standard [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database functions, including many advanced spatial types supported by the [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) extension. This enables real-time data analytics and integrating Fulcrum with a variety of Business Intelligence services and other platforms, as well as programmatically scripting custom data exports.

A more detailed [introduction](/query-api/intro/), [reference documentation](/query-api/reference/), and [examples](/query-api/examples/) have been included in a separate expanded section.

## Endpoints

## Notes

* The Query API is read-only and _cannot modify data_ in your account.
* You can use the Query API in conjunction with the [Records API](/endpoints/records/) to make updates to specific records by fetching the IDs of the records you want to PUT/DELETE.
* Be careful sharing queries that expose your API token. Even though the Query API is read-only, if a token with write privileges is used, your data could still be compromised. Consider creating a [custom role](http://www.fulcrumapp.com/help/creating-custom-roles/) with restricted permissions (uncheck all boxes for read-only).
